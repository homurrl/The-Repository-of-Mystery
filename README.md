# The-Repository-of-Mystery
This repository contains a carbon footprint calculator that can be used to estimate the amount of greenhouse gases that you produce each year. 


Carbon Footprint Calculator
This calculator estimates your carbon footprint based on your energy usage and transportation habits.

How to use
Enter your energy usage in therms and kwh.
Enter the number of miles you drive per week.
Click the "Calculate" button.
The calculator will display your estimated carbon footprint.
Variables
Therms
A therm is a unit of energy equal to 100,000 British thermal units (Btu). It is used to measure the energy content of natural gas, propane, and other heating fuels.

Kwh
A kilowatt-hour (kWh) is a unit of energy equal to 1,000 watt-hours. It is used to measure the energy consumption of electricity.

Kilometers driven per week
This is the number of kilometers you drive in a typical week.

Results
The calculator will display your estimated carbon footprint in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). CO2e is a unit that is used to measure the emissions of all greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide.
